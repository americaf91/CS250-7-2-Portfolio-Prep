How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Asking questions is a good place to start in order to understand the user’s needs. Creating effective communications about expectations is important because it can clarify lots of questions for someone if they know what the criteria is. User stories help because they clarify why the user wants certain features. I think a developer can use this to their advantage and possibly exceed the user’s expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Developing programs can get complex. It would be good to start by understanding the requirements and asking questions to clarify what is expected. Daily stand ups and sprints would be super useful to use in order to not only stay focused but also motivated. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means staying accountable and communicating with each other. Your team should know you are doing your part and communicating your progress. I think this is really the bare minimum someone can do in order to feel comfortable in a team, because ultimately, it is a group effort.
